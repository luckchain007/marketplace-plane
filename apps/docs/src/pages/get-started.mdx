# Get Started

This section of the Plane docs helps you get comfortable with the product and find your way around more effectively.

## Workspaces

Think of each workspace in Plane as a home for your content. Inside, workspace, you can creare projects as an individual, or invite collaborators to share a workspace as a team - it's up to you!

> When you sign up for the first time, we'll prompt you to create a new workspace. If you're invited to join, you can directly join the workspace without creating a new one.

## Projects

Projects let you manage teams and tasks within your Workspace. After creating your Workspace, you will need to create a new project.

> You can share the workspace with other members by granting them full access to the whole workspace, or by granting them limited access to specific projects.

<Note>
  You can manage members either by navigating to **Project > Member Settings**
  page or by **Workspace > Member Settings** page.

## Issues

In Plane, an issue is a task or piece of work. It could be small, like _Update the primary color to blue_, or large, like _Building GitHub integration on plane_. It all depends on how you and your team decide to break down your work into issues.

Issues are identified by a project-specific and unique number (Example, `VIH-19`), and they must be provided with a title and a state. All the other properties and relations are optional, know more about there [here]().

<Note>
  You can create issues by clicking on the `New Issue` button in the right-hand
  corner of your project, or by using `CTRL/CMD + I` shortcut.

## Issue Details

Inside an issue, you can add as many details as you like to get your work done. Here are five critical things to kick-start:

1. **Issue description**: An enhanced mardown editor inside issues to write as much detail you want. Attachments can be added and dragged around with a simple click, no need to save anything. Everything is auto-saved for you.

2. **Issue sub-properties**: We support basic issue properties such as `priority`, `label`, `due date`, and `assignee`. You can create relations between issues: mark them as `blocked` or `blocking`.

3. **Sub-issues**: You can create a `sub-issue` for an issue to either split the issue into smaller chunks, or assign parts of the issue to different people. If you find that a `sub-issue` is holding up the resolution of an issue, you can convert it to an issue so that it can be worked on separately.

4. **Issue Discussion**: Think, comment or join the conversation by sharing your thoughts under Issue discussion.

5. **Issue activity**: Track what's happening to your issue with activities. Everything is saved, so you can look back and see what happened. Real-time coming soon!

## Issue views

You can organize project issues into views, which let you see your work through different filters or parameters. You can choose from default views that come with your project and workspace or create your own.

- Every project has two primary views for issues - Board and List View.
- You can quickly and easily organize the issues on your board by grouping them or ordering them within views.
- You can toggle the visibility of issue sub-properties within views, at any time, based on your preferences.

## Plan better with Cycles

Cycles, (AKA Sprints) is a custom time period in which a team works to complete items on their backlog. At the end of the sprint, the team will usually have finished building and implementing a new version of their product.

- You can move existing issues to a new or existing cycle, or create a new issue directly.
- Bulk operations are supported--you can add or update multiple issues to cycles at once.
